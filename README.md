# SIMPLE SMART PARKING SYSTEM BASED ON IOT

Hello guys, welcome to my repo about Smart Parking System based on IoT!

And this requirement if you want to try this code:
1. IoT Platform (in this case i used Antares)
2. Iot Protocol (HTTP, you can change to MQTT, but change this code yourself üòÅ)
3. Mobile Apps (Android or IOS)

<br>

algorithm of this program is:
```
1. IF IR Sensor detected object (ex: IR slot 1 detected object) THEN `mobil` or car slot will decrement to 2 slot, and etc
2. IF from App Device set value of `gateControl` to True value, servo degree will change to 180deg or gate condition is open
```

Thankyouu!
